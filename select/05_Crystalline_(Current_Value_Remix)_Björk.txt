Underneath our feet
Crystals grow like plants
Listen how they grow
I'm blinded by the lights
Listen how they grow
In the core of the Earth
Listen how they glow

Crystalline
Internal nebula
Crystalline
Rocks growing slow but
Crystalline
I conquer claustrophobia
Crystalline
And demand the lights

We mimic the openness
Of the ones we love
Daft till our generosity
Equalize the flow
With our hearts
We kiss our quartz
To reach love

Crystalline
Internal nebula

Crystalline
Rocks growing slow but
Crystalline
I conquer claustrophobia
Crystalline
And demand the lights

Octagon, polygon
Pipes up an organ
Sonic branches
Murmuring drone
Crystalizing galaxies
Spread out like my fingers

Crystalline
Internal nebula
Crystalline
Rocks growing slow but
Crystalline
I conquer claustrophobia
Crystalline
And demand the lights

It's the sparkle you become
When you conquer anxiety
It's the sparkle you become
When you conquer anxiety
