Hollow, my ancestors have access
Hollow, I'm falling down the abyss
Hollow, looking for some answers
Generations of mothers sailing in
Somehow they all were ship folks
Hollow, the ground is opening up
Swallows, me up, the trunk of DNA
The trunk of DNA, trunk
Now come forth, all species
Hollow like a bead in necklace
Thread me upon this chain
I'm part of it, oh, the everlasting necklace
Jewels after jewels after jewels after
Jewels after jewels after jewels
I, I yearn to belong, let me belong
Let me belong, let me belong
