You smile
And there's blood on your lips
Your hands show again
What your mouth has kissed
Now I know something
I did not know before
The thing that you've destroyed
Is the thing you liked me for

All those nights with my arse in your face
And your words in my dreams
Now I know what the value of ignorance means

The pain
In the sordidness
All the more choices
I thought you'd be the best

At least I know something
About what's good and what hurts
And i'm glad that i loath it
You would have fucked me up worse

All those nights with my arse in your face
And your words in my dreams
Now I know what the value of ignorance means

All those nights with my arse in your face
And your words in my dreams
Now I know what the value of ignorance means

Don't you ever lie to me again
Because if you do
I will not be you friend

Oooooh oh
Oooooh oh
Oooooh oh
