You've never come close to seeing
What I've always had to face
Image blatant and obvious
What's there more to assess?

Never looking beyond the frontal
All your present fears
I hope to never be caught again
By the visions too clear

Erase it
Deface it
Conceal it

Just take it for the face value
Concealment, nonetheless
Just take it for the face value
You never know what you may get
Just take it for the face value
Concealment, nonetheless

A wise man carried on about
What you see is what you get
I've peeled off covers
Revealing what I want to forget
Just go and base yourself on simple visages
Scarring the complexion or scratching the surface

Just take it for the face value
Concealment, nonetheless
Just take it for the face value
You never know what you may get

You never know what you may get
Face value, face value

Erase it
Deface it
Conceal it

Just take it for the face value
Concealment, nonetheless
Just take it for the face value
You never know what you may get

Face value, face value
Face value
